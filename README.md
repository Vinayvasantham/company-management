Company Management App
A simple full-stack web application for managing company data, built with FastAPI for the backend, React for the frontend, and MySQL for the database. This app allows users to:

* View a list of companies

* Add new companies with a name and location

* Update and delete companies

The backend exposes RESTful APIs to interact with the database, and the frontend communicates with these APIs to display and manage the data. This project demonstrates the integration of FastAPI, React, and MySQL, along with basic CRUD operations.
